Racket Continuations
====================
These are all studies and experiments with continuations in DrRacket.

It will also probably grow to include studies with streams.

The main advantage of studying with Racket is the possibility to write tests directly together with the executing code.

Racket is chosen also because it contains a more or less direct link with Scheme (Little and Seasoned Schemer)
