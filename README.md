Racket Continuations
====================
These are all studies and experiments with continuations in Dr.Racket.
There are also some experiments with JavaScript along the way.

It will also probably grow to include studies with streams.

The main advantages of studying with Racket are:
- the possibility to write tests directly together with the executing code
- the possibility fo follow execution in the stepper (and learn from your own mistakes)

Racket is chosen also because it contains a direct link with Scheme (see Little and Seasoned Schemer)
