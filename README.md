Racket Continuations
====================
These are all studies and experiments with continuations in DrRacket.

It will also probably grow to include studies with streams.

The main advantages of studying with Racket are:
- the possibility to write tests directly together with the executing code
- the possibility fo follow execution in the stepper (and learn from your own mistakes)

Racket is chosen also because it contains a direct link with Scheme (see Little and Seasoned Schemer)
